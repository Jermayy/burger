An application created using Node.js, Express.js and Express-Handlebar frameworks as well as MySQL where the user can enter burgers they would like to eat. User entered items will appear in the 'burgers yet to be eaten!' list with an 'Eaten!' button. Once pressed, burgers will be moved to the 'Burgers that have been eaten' list.
